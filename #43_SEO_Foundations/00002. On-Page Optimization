On-Page Optimization:
On-page optimization focuses on optimizing individual web pages to rank higher in search engine results. Key elements include:

a) Meta Tags: Writing compelling meta titles and descriptions incorporating relevant keywords helps search engines and users understand the content of a page. It also influences click-through rates (CTRs).

b) URL Structure: Creating clean and descriptive URLs improves the user experience and helps search engines crawl and index your site more effectively.

c) Header Tags: Organizing content using header tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.) helps search engines understand the structure of your page and improves readability for users.

d) Content Optimization: Creating high-quality, informative, and engaging content is crucial. Including relevant keywords naturally throughout the content can help search engines identify the page's relevance.
