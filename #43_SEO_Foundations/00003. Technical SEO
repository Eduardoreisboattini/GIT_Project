Technical SEO:
Technical SEO focuses on optimizing the technical aspects of a website to enhance its crawling and indexing by search engines. Key elements include:

a) Site Speed: Optimizing page load times is essential for user experience and search engine rankings. Compressing images, minifying CSS and JavaScript, and leveraging browser caching are some techniques to improve site speed.

b) Mobile Optimization: With the majority of internet users accessing websites through mobile devices, ensuring your site is mobile-friendly is crucial. Responsive design, fast mobile loading times, and intuitive navigation contribute to better user experience and search rankings.

c) Site Architecture: Creating a clear and logical website structure improves both user experience and search engine crawling. Implementing XML sitemaps and optimizing internal linking helps search engines discover and understand your website's content.
