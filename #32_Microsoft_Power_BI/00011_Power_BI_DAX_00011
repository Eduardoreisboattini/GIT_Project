+1. To create a DAX code for integration with Excel and Power BI, we need to follow these steps:
+
+2. Step 1: Install necessary packages and dependencies
+   a. Download and install Microsoft Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO) from the following link: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48127
+   b. Download and install Microsoft Power BI Desktop from the following link: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=45331
+
+3. Step 2: Create a new Excel workbook
+   a. Open Excel and click on "File" > "New" > "Workbook"
+
+4. Step 3: Add data to the Excel workbook
+   a. Insert data into the workbook by either typing it in manually or by importing it from a file.
+
+5. Step 4: Create a Power BI report
+   a. Open Power BI Desktop and click on "File" > "New" > "Report"
+   b. Select the Excel workbook you created in Step 3 as the data source for the Power BI report.
+
+6. Step 5: Write DAX code for data manipulation and analysis
+   a. In the Power BI report, click on "Visualizations" > "Table" to create a table visual.
+   b. In the "Values" section of the table visual, write a DAX expression to perform data manipulation and analysis. For example, you can write a DAX code to calculate the sum of a column or to filter rows based on a condition.
+
+7. Step 6: Visualize the results
+   a. In the Power BI report, click on "Visualizations" > "Chart" or "Map" to create a visual representation of the data in the table visual.
+   b. Customize the appearance and layout of the visualizations as needed.
+
+8. Step 7: Save and share the Power BI report
+   a. Click on "File" > "Save" to save the Power BI report as a .pbix file.
+   b. Share the .pbix file with others to view and analyze the results in their own Power BI Desktop installations.
