        # In Power BI, use the API endpoint to fetch data:
        # Go to Get Data > Web in Power BI and enter the API URL (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/api/powerbi/).
        # Or, connect directly to the Azure SQL database in Power BI via Get Data > Azure SQL Database.
        # By following these steps, you will be able to connect Django to Azure SQL Server and extract data for Power BI integration.
