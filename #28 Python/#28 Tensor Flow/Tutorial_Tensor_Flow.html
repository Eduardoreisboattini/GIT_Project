    <h1>Everything You Need to Know About Tensor Flow</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Introduction to Tensor Flow</h2>
        <p>Tensor Flow is an open-source software library for numerical computation, particularly well-suited and fine-tuned for large-scale Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) tasks. Its primary use is in developing and training artificial neural networks, particularly deep neural networks.</p>
        <p>Tensor Flow allows developers to easily implement popular DL architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Autoencoders. It is also applicable to a wide range of other domains, such as robotics, natural language processing, computer vision, and signal processing.</p>

        <h2>Installation and Setup</h2>
        <p>To install Tensor Flow, use the following command in Python:</p>
        <pre><code>pip install tensorflow</code></pre>
        <p>After installation, you can load the package with the following command:</p>
        <pre><code>import tensorflow as tf</code></pre>
        <p>Basic setup and configuration steps include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating a new directory for your project.</li>
            <li>Creating a new Python script file.</li>
            <li>Defining the input data.</li>
            <li>Defining the model architecture.</li>
            <li>Training the model.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Core Concepts and Components</h2>
        <p>The core concepts of Tensor Flow are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tensors</strong>: These are multi-dimensional arrays of numerical values.</li>
            <li><strong>Graphs</strong>: These are collections of nodes and edges used to represent mathematical operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Sessions</strong>: These are objects that encapsulate the environment in which graphs are executed.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Basic Usage</h2>
        <p>Here are some examples of basic usage:</p>
        <pre><code>
            import tensorflow as tf

            # Create a constant tensor
            hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')

            # Create a session
            sess = tf.Session()

            # Run the session
            print(sess.run(hello))
        </code></pre>
        <p>This will output the string "Hello, TensorFlow!"</p>
