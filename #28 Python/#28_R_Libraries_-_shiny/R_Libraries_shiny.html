    <section>
        <h2>Introduction to shiny</h2>
        <p>shiny is a powerful R library for creating web applications. It provides a grammar for data manipulation and visualization, making it easy to create interactive web applications that can be used to explore data and create visualizations.</p>
        <p>The main features of shiny are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Easy to use: shiny is designed to be easy to use, with a syntax that is similar to SQL.</li>
            <li>Fast: shiny is fast, and can handle large datasets with ease.</li>
            <li>Flexible: shiny is flexible, and can be used for a wide range of web development tasks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>shiny is useful for developers because it provides a powerful and flexible way to create web applications. It is easy to use, and can be used to quickly create high-quality web applications.</p>

        <h2>Installation and Setup</h2>
        <p>To install shiny, use the following command in R:</p>
        <pre><code>install.packages("shiny")</code></pre>
        <p>After installation, you can load the package with the following command:</p>
        <pre><code>library(shiny)</code></pre>
        <p>Basic setup and configuration steps include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating a new directory for your project.</li>
            <li>Creating a new R script file.</li>
            <li>Defining the user interface.</li>
            <li>Defining the server logic.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Core Concepts and Components</h2>
        <p>The core concepts of shiny are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>UI</strong>: This is the user interface of the application. It is typically defined in a ui.R file.</li>
            <li><strong>Server</strong>: This is the server logic of the application. It is typically defined in a server.R file.</li>
            <li><strong>Reactive Expressions</strong>: These are expressions that are evaluated whenever a reactive input changes. They are typically used to create reactive outputs, such as data tables or plots.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Basic Usage</h2>
        <p>Here are some examples of basic usage:</p>
        <pre><code>
            # Create a new shiny application
            library(shiny)

            # Define the user interface
            ui <- fluidPage(
                sliderInput("n", "Number of observations:", 1, 100, 50),
                plotOutput("distPlot")
            )

            # Define the server logic
            server <- function(input, output) {
                output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
                    dist <- rnorm(input$n)
                    hist(dist)
                })
            }

            # Run the application
            runApp(list(ui = ui, server = server))
        </code></pre>

        <h2>Advanced Features</h2>
        <p>shiny has many advanced features, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reactive Expressions</strong>: These are expressions that are evaluated whenever a reactive input changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Reactive Outputs</strong>: These are outputs that are created by reactive expressions.</li>
            <li><strong>Inputs</strong>: These are inputs that can be used to change the reactive expressions.</li>
            <li><strong>Outputs</strong>: These are outputs that are created by the reactive expressions.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Best Practices</h2>
        <p>Here are some best practices for using shiny:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use meaningful variable names</strong>: This makes your code more readable and easier to understand.</li>
            <li><strong>Use the built-in verbs</strong>: These are the functions that are built into shiny, such as <code>renderText()</code> and <code>renderPlot()</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Use reactive expressions</strong>: These are expressions that are evaluated whenever a reactive input changes.</li>
        </ul>
