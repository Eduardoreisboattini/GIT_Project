# Python == and != operators to compare object equality. 
# Here, you're generally comparing the value of two objects. 
# This is what you need if you want to compare whether or not two objects have the same contents, and you don't care about where they're stored in memory.
#          >        
#          >=       
#          <
#          <=
#          ==       Equality operator returns 
#          !=       Not equality operator returns True if two variables are of same type and have different values, if the values are same then it returns False.
#          !=       Python is dynamic and strongly typed language, so if the two variables have the same values but they are of different type, then not equal operator will return True
