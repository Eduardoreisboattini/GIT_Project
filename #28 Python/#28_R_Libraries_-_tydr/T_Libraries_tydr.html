        <h2>Installation and Setup</h2>
        <p>To install tydr, use the following command in R:</p>
        <pre><code>install.packages("tydr")</code></pre>
        <p>After installation, you can load the package with the following command:</p>
        <pre><code>library(tydr)</code></pre>
        <p>Basic setup and configuration steps include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating a new directory for your project.</li>
            <li>Creating a new R script file.</li>
            <li>Defining the user interface.</li>
            <li>Defining the server logic.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Core Concepts and Components</h2>
        <p>The core concepts of tydr are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>UI</strong>: This is the user interface of the application. It is typically defined in a ui.R file.</li>
            <li><strong>Server</strong>: This is the server logic of the application. It is typically defined in a server.R file.</li>
            <li><strong>Reactive Expressions</strong>: These are expressions that are evaluated whenever a reactive input changes. They are typically used to create reactive outputs, such as data tables or plots.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Basic Usage</h2>
        <p>Here are some examples of basic usage:</p>
        <pre><code>
            # Create a new tydr application
            library(tydr)

            # Define the user interface
            ui <- fluidPage(
                sliderInput("n", "Number of observations:", 1, 100, 50),
                plotOutput("distPlot")
            )

            # Define the server logic
            server <- function(input, output) {
                output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
                    dist <- rnorm(input$n)
                    hist(dist)
                })
            }

            # Run the application
            runApp(list(ui = ui, server = server))
        </code></pre>

        <h2>Advanced Features</h2>
        <p>tydr has many advanced features, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reactive Outputs</strong>: These are outputs that are created by reactive expressions.</li>
            <li><strong>Inputs</strong>: These are inputs that can be used to change the reactive expressions.</li>
            <li><strong>Outputs</strong>: These are outputs that are created by the reactive expressions.</li>
        </ul>
