    <h1>Django Python to Database System</h1>
    <p>
        Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
        Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel.
        It's free and open source.
    </p>
    <p>
        Django provides an abstraction layer between the web framework and the database.
        It provides an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) system which abstracts the underlying database, allowing you to interact with it using Python.
        This allows you to define your models using Python classes, and then use those models to create and manage your database.
    </p>
    <p>
        Django also provides a lot of built-in functionality for common tasks, such as user authentication and authorization, URL routing, and template rendering.
        This makes it easy to build robust and scalable web applications quickly.
    </p>
