//Variables and Data Types
//Variables are containers that hold values. In JavaScript, you can declare variables using the var, let, or const keywords. For example:
var myNumber = 10;
let myString = "Hello, world!";
const myBoolean = true;

//JavaScript supports several data types, including:
//Numbers: integer or floating-point numbers
//Strings: sequences of characters enclosed in quotes (single or double)
//Booleans: true or false
//Arrays: ordered collections of values, enclosed in square brackets
//Objects: unordered collections of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces
