    <section>
        <h2>Introduction to ggplot</h2>
        <p>ggplot is a powerful R library for data visualization. It is part of the tidyverse suite of packages, and is designed to be used in conjunction with other tidyverse packages such as dplyr and tidyr.</p>
        <p>The main features of ggplot are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Easy to use: ggplot is designed to be easy to use, with a syntax that is similar to SQL.</li>
            <li>Fast: ggplot is fast, and can handle large datasets with ease.</li>
            <li>Flexible: ggplot is flexible, and can be used for a wide range of data visualization tasks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>ggplot is useful for developers because it provides a powerful and flexible way to visualize data. It is easy to use, and can be used to quickly create high-quality visualizations.</p>

        <h2>Installation and Setup</h2>
        <p>To install ggplot, use the following command in R:</p>
        <pre><code>install.packages("ggplot2")</code></pre>
        <p>After installation, you can load the package with the following command:</p>
        <pre><code>library(ggplot2)</code></pre>

        <h2>Core Concepts and Components</h2>
        <p>The core concepts of ggplot are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Layers</strong>: These are the individual components of a plot. Examples include <code>geom_point()</code> and <code>geom_line()</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Aesthetics</strong>: These are the visual properties of a plot. Examples include <code>color</code> and <code>size</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Data</strong>: This is the data that is being plotted. Examples include <code>data.frame()</code> and <code>tibble()</code>.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Basic Usage</h2>
        <p>Here are some examples of basic usage:</p>
        <pre><code>
            library(ggplot2)

            # Scatter plot
            ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) + geom_point()

            # Line plot
            ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = unemploy)) + geom_line()
        </code></pre>
    </section>

        <h2>Advanced Features</h2>
        <p>ggplot has many advanced features, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Facets</strong>: These are used to create multiple plots from a single data set. Examples include <code>facet_wrap()</code> and <code>facet_grid()</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Transformations</strong>: These are used to manipulate the data before plotting. Examples include <code>scale_x_log10()</code> and <code>scale_y_sqrt()</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Interactivity</strong>: This is the ability to interact with the plot, such as zooming and panning. Examples include <code>ggplotly()</code> and <code>gganimate()</code>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Best Practices</h2>
        <p>Here are some best practices for using ggplot effectively:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use descriptive variable names and comments to make your code clear and readable.</li>
            <li>Use the <em>ggplot()</em> function with the <em>data</em> argument to specify the data to be plotted.</li>
            <li>Use the <em>geom()</em> function with the <em>mapping</em> argument to specify the aesthetics of the plot.</li>
            <li>Use the <em>theme()</em> function to customize the appearance of the plot.</li>
        </ul>
