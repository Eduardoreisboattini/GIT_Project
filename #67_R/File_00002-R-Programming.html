    <h1>R Studio Windows Concepts</h1>
    <p>
        R Studio is a popular Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R, a programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for data analysis, visualization, and modeling. R Studio has four main windows that make it easy to explore and analyze data. The four windows are:
    </p>
    <h2>Console Window</h2>
    <p>
        The Console window is where you can execute R commands. It is a text-based interface where you can type commands and see the results. The Console window also provides a history of all commands you have entered and their results.
    </p>
    <h2>Source Window</h2>
    <p>
        The Source window is where you can view and edit your R code. It is a text editor that provides features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools. The Source window is also used to create new R scripts and to edit existing ones.
    </p>
    <h2>Environment Window</h2>
    <p>
        The Environment window shows the current state of your R environment. It displays all the objects you have created such as data, functions, and plots. The Environment window also provides tools for importing and exporting data, as well as for managing your R packages.
    </p>
    <h2>Plots Window</h2>
    <p>
        The Plots window is where your R plots are displayed. It provides tools for zooming, panning, and saving plots. The Plots window also allows you to interact with your plots, such as hovering over points to see their values.
