8# Basic Mathematics for Programming

## 1. Arithmetic Operations
Arithmetic operations are fundamental in programming. They include:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulo (%) - remainder after division

## 2. Order of Operations
To avoid ambiguity, we follow the order of operations:
- PEMDAS/BODMAS (Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication, and Division, Addition, and Subtraction)

## 3. Variables and Expressions
Variables store data and allow us to create expressions:
- Assigning values to variables
- Using variables in mathematical expressions
- Updating variable values
- Compound expressions with multiple operations
- Increment (++) and decrement (--) operators

## 4. Boolean Logic
Boolean logic helps make decisions in code using true or false values:
- Boolean data type (true or false)
- Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- Boolean expressions and truth tables
- De Morgan's Laws - negating complex conditions
- Short-circuit evaluation for efficient code

## 5. Relational Operators
Relational operators compare values and return true or false:
- Equal to (==)
- Not equal to (!=)
- Greater than (>)
- Less than (<)
- Greater than or equal to (>=)
- Less than or equal to (<=)

## 6. Conditional Statements
Conditional statements allow us to make decisions in code:
- If statements - executing code based on a condition
- Else statements - alternative execution
- Else-if statements - multiple conditions
- Nested conditionals - conditional inside another conditional
- Switch statements - handling multiple cases

## 7. Loops
Loops help execute code repeatedly based on a condition:
- While loop - condition-controlled loop
- For loop - definite number of iterations
- Do-while loop - guarantees at least one execution
- Loop control statements (break and continue) - controlling loop flow
- Nested loops - loop inside another loop

## 8. Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code:
- Declaring and defining functions
- Parameters and arguments - passing data to functions
- Return statement - getting values back
- Recursive functions - functions calling themselves
- Function libraries - modular programming

## 9. Arrays
Arrays store multiple values in a single variable:
- Creating and initializing arrays

- Bit manipulation tricks

## 12. Mathematical Constants
Utilizing commonly used mathematical constants:
- Pi (π) - the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter
