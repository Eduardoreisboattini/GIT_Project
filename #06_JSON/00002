//In this example, the JSON object has five key-value pairs, 
//including a string value, a number value, a boolean value, 
//an array value, and a nested JSON object value.
//JSON has become a popular data format for web services and APIs because it is 
//platform and language independent, making it easy to send and receive data
//between different systems. 
//It is also widely used for storing and exchanging data in NoSQL databases 
//and document-oriented databases like MongoDB, as well as for configuration files
//and data exchange between applications.//
