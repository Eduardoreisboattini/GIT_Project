What is JSON?
JSON (Java Script Object Notation)  is a a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
It is primarly used to transmit ata between a server anda a web application, serving as a common language for exchanging data.

Structure of JSON
Objects:
An object in JSON is represented a set of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces {}.
Keys are always strings, and values can be any valid JSON data type (string, number, boolean, null, object, array)
Example:
"name": "Herbert Richards"
"age": "73",
"isStudent": "true",

Arrays
An array in JSON is an ordered collection of values enclosed in square brackets []. The values can be any of valid JSON data types (string, number, boolean, null, object, array) including objects and arrays themselves. Example:
"apple"
"banana"
"watermellow"
"orange"
"lemmon"
"seagreen"

Nested objects and arrays:
JSON allows nesting objects and arrays within each other to represent more complex data structures.
Example:
{
"name": "Herbert Richards",
"age": "73"
"hobbies": ["reading", "swimming", "photography", "writing", "cooking", "paiting", "collections", "automobiles"],
"adress": {
    "street": "Paulista Avenue",
    "number": "900",
    "city": "Sao Paulo",
    "cep": "01311200",
    District: "Vila Maria",
    "country": "Brazil"
}
